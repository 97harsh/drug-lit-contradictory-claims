01lyavy2,Abstract,"then, the really positive treatment could be the activation of ace2 with direct activators that could have two complementary therapeutic effects: on one side, avoiding the binding of protein s of sars-cov-2 to ace2, and at the same time, promoting the protective effects of the enzyme on different organs preventing fibrosis and lung injury. the infection could remain in the upper respiratory tract and prevent other clinical complications in patients.",protein s,,0
01yzk0au,Discussion,"the mechanism for coagulopathy in patients with covid-19 is currently unknown. 7 the thromboembolic events described in these cases occurred after the cytokine storm and during the third week of the disease, despite having no risk factors for thromboembolism and being on intermediate prophylaxis dose. the arterial clots removed at surgery in the patient described in case two were white and consistent with being platelet-rich. 8 it is unclear and perhaps unlikely that the same mechanisms are involved in venous as in arterial clots, but this gross appearance suggested an important role of platelets and the possibility that anti-platelet agents, such as aspirin, may play a role in preventing arterial thromboembolic complications. 9 in terms of preventing and treating venous thromboembolic disease there remains limited evidence or guidance from well-controlled trials on whether low-molecular-weight heparin, unfractionated heparin, direct factor xa inhibitors, direct thrombin inhibition or other approaches are optimal. 10  the mechanism for coagulopathy in patients with covid‚Äê19 is currently unknown.","heparin,aspirin,factor x,heparin,thrombin",,0
