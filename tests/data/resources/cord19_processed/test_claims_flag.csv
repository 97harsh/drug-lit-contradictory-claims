01es0zv4,Abstract,"coronavirus disease 2019 has become a global pandemic. it is still uncontrolled in most countries and no therapies are currently available. various drugs are under investigation for its treatment. the disease is known to have worse outcomes in patients who have underlying cardiovascular disease. chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, remdesivir and lopinavir/ritonavir are currently being studied in trials and show some promise. conduction disorders, heart failure and mortality have been reported with the use of these drugs. it is important to have a knowledge of potential cardiotoxic effects of these drugs before using them for covid-19 patients for better allocation of healthcare resources and improvement in clinical outcomes.","chloroquine,lopinavir,remdesivir,ritonavir,azithromycin,chloroquine,hydroxychloroquine,lopinavir,ritonavir",it is important to have a knowledge of potential cardiotoxic effects of these drugs before using them for covid-19 patients for better allocation of healthcare resources and improvement in clinical outcomes.,1

01lyavy2,Abstract,"then, the really positive treatment could be the activation of ace2 with direct activators that could have two complementary therapeutic effects: on one side, avoiding the binding of protein s of sars-cov-2 to ace2, and at the same time, promoting the protective effects of the enzyme on different organs preventing fibrosis and lung injury. the infection could remain in the upper respiratory tract and prevent other clinical complications in patients.",protein s,,0
01yzk0au,Discussion,"the mechanism for coagulopathy in patients with covid-19 is currently unknown. 7 the thromboembolic events described in these cases occurred after the cytokine storm and during the third week of the disease, despite having no risk factors for thromboembolism and being on intermediate prophylaxis dose. the arterial clots removed at surgery in the patient described in case two were white and consistent with being platelet-rich. 8 it is unclear and perhaps unlikely that the same mechanisms are involved in venous as in arterial clots, but this gross appearance suggested an important role of platelets and the possibility that anti-platelet agents, such as aspirin, may play a role in preventing arterial thromboembolic complications. 9 in terms of preventing and treating venous thromboembolic disease there remains limited evidence or guidance from well-controlled trials on whether low-molecular-weight heparin, unfractionated heparin, direct factor xa inhibitors, direct thrombin inhibition or other approaches are optimal. 10  the mechanism for coagulopathy in patients with covid‐19 is currently unknown.","heparin,aspirin,factor x,heparin,thrombin",,0
02q9y011,Abstract,"the virus that causes covid-19, sars-cov-2, has a large rna genome that encodes numerous proteins that might be targets for antiviral drugs. some of these proteins, such as the rna-dependent rna polymers, helicase and main protease, are well conserved between sars-cov-2 and the original sars virus, but several others are not. this study examines one of the proteins encoded by sars-cov-2 that is most different, a macrodomain of nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3). although 26% of the amino acids in this sars-cov-2 macrodomain differ from those seen in other coronaviruses, biochemical and structural data reveal that the protein retains the ability to bind adp-ribose, which is an important characteristic of beta coronaviruses, and potential therapeutic target.",amino acids,"although 26% of the amino acids in this sars-cov-2 macrodomain differ from those seen in other coronaviruses, biochemical and structural data reveal that the protein retains the ability to bind adp-ribose, which is an important characteristic of beta coronaviruses, and potential therapeutic target.",1
033q671f,Added value of this study,"in this retrospective and multicenter cohort study, we reported demographics characteristics, baseline symptoms, laboratory findings, corticosteroid usage and hospital course of patients with non-severe covid-19 and severe covid-19. comparing with non-severe patients, severe patients with covid-19 was found to have a longer: time to clinical recovery (12.9±4.4 vs 8.3±4.7; p=0.0011), duration of viral shedding (15.7±6.7 vs 11.8±5.0; p=0.0183), and hospital stay (20.7±1.2 vs 14.4±4.3; p=0.0211). by multivariate logistic regression, we found increasing odds of converting to severe cases associated with lower lymphocyte count (odds ratio 1.28, 95%ci 1.06-1.54, per 0.1×10 9 /l reduced; p=0.007). using of low-to-moderate doses of systematic corticosteroids was associated with reduced likelihood of converting to a severe case (odds ratio 0.14, 95%ci 0.02-0.80; p=0.0275).","corticosteroids,ultiva",,0

03dzqten,Abstract,"a multiple sclerosis patient infected by sars-cov-2 during fingolimod therapy was hospitalized with moderate clinical features, and recovered in 15 days. high levels of ccl5 and ccl10 chemokines and of antibody-secreting b cells were detected, while the levels other b-and t-cell subsets were comparable to that of appropriate controls. however, cd4+ and cd8+ cells were oligoclonally expanded and prone to apoptosis when stimulated in vitro. this study suggests that fingolimod-immunosuppressed patients, despite the low circulating lymphocytes, may rapidly expand antibody-secreting cells and mount an effective immune response that favors covid-19 recovery after discontinuation.",fingolimod,"this study suggests that fingolimod-immunosuppressed patients, despite the low circulating lymphocytes, may rapidly expand antibody-secreting cells and mount an effective immune response that favors covid-19 recovery after discontinuation.",1
03dzqten,Discussion,"in this study, we demonstrate that the only relevant findings observed in the immunosuppressed covid-19 ms patient were the increase of ccl5 and ccl10 chemokines and of asc population. the detection of high levels of ccl5, which is involved in ifn-γ-dominant th1 responses and it is a mediator in t-cell recruitment to the lung, suggests a potential role of this chemokine in the mobilization of t lymphocytes and monocytes to pulmonary tissues (culley et al., 2006) . inter-individual immune system heterogeneity (brodin et al., 2017) . however, this report shows that despite ms patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment may be at greatest risk of covid-19 complications, the fingolimod-treated ms patient herein described, even in the presence of low circulating lymphocytes, was able to mount an effective immune response. surprisingly, this patient survived covid-19, had relative short duration of symptoms and well recovered, despite obesity, which is a main risk factor in covid-19 patients (stefan et al., 2020) . it is important to mention that could be also concerns regarding stopping some ms therapies in setting of infections, especially fingolimod, because of the described rebounds , occurring in 5% of patients (frau j et al., 2018) . during hospitalization, the covid-19 patient remained without therapy for about one month and she did not developed ms symptoms during this period. however, it must be remembered that fingolimod induces a different immune reconstitution compared to other ms disease modifying therapies and that the immune response may be faster and more robust when fingolimod is stopped, since this drug just blocks lymphocyte egress from lymph nodes. accordingly, there is a greater concern for drugs that deplete immune cells (giovannoni et al., 2020) . despite the several limitations of this study, which include the description of a single case only, unknown impact of stopping fingolimod versus continuing fingolimod and lack of sample to analyze from day of hospitalization, these results seem to be slightly reassuring and in line with what has already been reported on the management of ms treatments in italy the time of the pandemic covid-19 (sormani et al., 2020) . in conclusion, this is an ""immunological case report"" from one of italy's most severely affected pandemic areas. it would be important to characterize higher number of cases in the future and to complement the results those that will be obtained by the ongoing clinical trial aimed at j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f  in this study, we demonstrate that the only relevant findings observed in the immunosuppressed covid-19 ms patient were the increase of ccl5 and ccl10 chemokines and of asc population. the detection of high levels of ccl5, which is involved in ifn-γ-dominant th1 responses and it is a mediator in t-cell recruitment to the lung, suggests a potential role of this chemokine in the mobilization of t lymphocytes and monocytes to pulmonary tissues (culley et al., 2006). the high levels of asc could be crucial for controlling viral infection, as demonstrated during infection with influenza and ebola viruses and after vaccination against influenza virus (mcelroy et al., 2015; ellebedy et al., 2016; fujii et al., 2016). most t-lymphocyte subset levels were low, but comparable to those generally detected in non- sars-cov-2 infected patients during and at discontinuation of fingolimod therapy. it could be hypothesized that antigen-specific t cells can be induced to exit lymph nodes by sars-cov-2, but this feature may not be not detected by immunophenotyping. it is also likely that the viral infection can result in a strong antigenic stimulation leading to increased number of hla-dr+ cells in both cd4+ and cd8+ subsets. this can account for the oligoclonal t-cell repertoire and for the high propensity to apoptosis, as shown by the impaired response to pha. because of the immunological abnormalities observed in ms patients and of the changes induced by fingolimod (sica et al., 2019), it is difficult to define which of the immunological features described in the covid-19 patient are mainly attributable to sars-cov-2 infection or to inter-individual immune system heterogeneity (brodin and davis, 2017). however, this report shows that despite ms patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment may be at greatest risk of covid-19 complications, the fingolimod-treated ms patient herein described, even in the presence of low circulating lymphocytes, was able to mount an effective immune response. surprisingly, this patient survived covid-19, had relative short duration of symptoms and well recovered, despite obesity, which is a main risk factor in covid-19 patients (stefan et al., 2020). it is important to mention that could be also concerns regarding stopping some ms therapies in setting of infections, especially fingolimod, because of the described rebounds, occurring in 5% of patients (frau et al., 2018). during hospitalization, the covid-19 patient remained without therapy for about one month and she did not developed ms symptoms during this period. however, it must be remembered that fingolimod induces a different immune reconstitution compared to other ms disease modifying therapies and that the immune response may be faster and more robust when fingolimod is stopped, since this drug just blocks lymphocyte egress from lymph nodes. accordingly, there is a greater concern for drugs that deplete immune cells (giovannoni et al., 2020). despite the several limitations of this study, which include the description of a single case only, unknown impact of stopping fingolimod versus continuing fingolimod and lack of sample to analyze from day of hospitalization, these results seem to be slightly reassuring and in line with what has already been reported on the management of ms treatments in italy the time of the pandemic covid-19 (sormani et al., 2020). in conclusion, this is an “immunological case report” from one of italy's most severely affected pandemic areas. it would be important to characterize higher number of cases in the future and to complement the results those that will be obtained by the ongoing clinical trial aimed at determining the efficacy of fingolimod to prevent the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with covid-19 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show / nct04280588).",fingolimod,it would be important to characterize higher number of cases in the future and to complement the results those that will be obtained by the ongoing clinical trial aimed at determining the efficacy of fingolimod to prevent the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with covid-19 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show / nct04280588).,1
03isjlif,Abstract,"purpose recently, the world has been dealing with a new type of coronavirus called covid-19 that in terms of symptoms is similar to the sars coronavirus. unfortunately, researchers could not find a registered therapy to treat the infection related to the virus yet. regarding the fact that drug repurposing is a good strategy for epidemic viral infection, we applied the drug repurposing strategy using virtual screening to identify therapeutic options for covid-19. for this purpose, five proteins of covid-19 (3chymotrypsin-like protease (3clpro), papain-like protease (plpro), cleavage site, hr1 and rbd in spike protein) were selected as target proteins for drug repositioning. methods first, five proteins of covid-19 were built by homology modeling. then fda-approved drugs (2471 drugs) were screened against cleavage site and rbd in spike protein via virtual screening. one hundred and twenty-eight fda-approved drugs with the most favorable free-binding energy were attached to the cleavage site and rbd in spike protein. of these 128 drugs, 18 drugs have either been used currently as antiviral or have been reported to possess antiviral effects. virtual screening was then performed for the 18 selected drugs with ace2, 3clpro and plpro and hr1 and tmprss2. results according to the results, glecaprevir, paritaprevir, simeprevir, ledipasvir, glycyrrhizic acid, tmc-310911, and hesperidin showed highly favorably free binding energies with all tested target proteins.","chymotrypsin,glecaprevir,glycyrrhizic acid,hesperidin,ledipasvir,papain,paritaprevir,simeprevir,trypsin",,0

03isjlif,Results and discussion,"hesperidin is a flavonoid extracted from citrus fruit. it has multiple biological and antimicrobial activities against human viruses. based on a study conducted in 2009, glucosyl hesperidin has an inhibiting role against the replication of influenza a virus [27] . in a study aimed at analyzing therapeutic targets for covid-19 by computational methods, it was shown that hesperidin disrupts in the interaction of ace2 with rbd [1] . as mentioned earlier, the 3clpro can be an effective target for treatment of coronavirus. a study on investigation of the effect of active compounds on the inhibition of 3clpro showed that hesperidin was the most potent inhibitor of 3clpro among the compounds which were tested. based on docking score, it was reported that hesperidin and glycyrrhizin are favorable in terms of binding to ace2 and 3clpro [28] . tmc-310911 is another fda-approved drug that has good binding with target proteins. tmc-310911 is a new investigational protease inhibitor that is being investigated for use in hiv-1 infections. tmc-310911 is currently being investigated as a potential treatment for covid-19 (https://www.drugbank. ca/). fda-approved drugs were screened against cleavage site and rbd in spike protein via virtual screening in this present study. it was observed that 128 fda-approved drugs with the most suitable free-binding energy (out of 2471 drugs) were attached to the cleavage site and rbd in spike protein. of these 128 drugs, 18 drugs have either been used currently as antiviral or have been reported to possess antiviral effects. virtual screening was then performed for the 18 selected drugs with ace2 (major covid_19 receptor), 3clpro and plpro (main enzymes in viral replication) and hr1 (main domain in virus fusion with the host cell membrane) and tmprss2 (main enzyme in activating the viral spike glycoproteins). according to the results, 7 drugs with all the target proteins achieved the most favorable free binding energy (table 1). the protein complexes with these seven drugs are shown in figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions of docked molecules were visualized using ligplot program (table 2). as shown in table 2, glycyrrhizic acid and hesperidin showed highest number of bonds with ace2 and rbd. as shown in table 1, paritaprevir and simeprevir have favorable binding energy to most target proteins and may be considered as therapeutic options for the coronavirus. these drugs were originally used in the treatment of chronic hepatitis c and can effectively bind to target proteins [10, 19, 20]. there are other drugs with good binding energy to target protein; one of them is ledipasvir. according to an in silico study, ledipasvir is an antiviral drug with the minimum side effects that can be applied in the treatment of covid19 [21]. in the present study, medicinal compounds of plant origin were also attached with favorable binding energy to the target proteins. glycyrrhizic acid which has plant origins is obtained from the roots of the licorice plant. triterpene glycoside and glycyrrhetinic acid are used pharmacologically. the latter is applied as a hepatoprotective option to treat chronic hepatitis in japan and china (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/glycyrrhizic-acid). in addition, glycyrrhizin, being non-toxic [22], is also used widely as a sars treatment option. according to a study in 2003, glycyrrhizin has a preventive role in sars [23]. furthermore, based on studies, it plays an effective role in the hepatitis c virus (hcv) because it can influence the release phase associated with the infection of cells [24]. using glycyrrhizin to treat hepatitis c is not a new method and it has been applied as a treatment for 20 years in japan. fortunately, the studies have shown its preventive role in the progression of cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma and only few side effects [25]. the positive effects of glycyrrhizin have been proven on many viral diseases, such as herpes simplex type 1 (hsv-1), varicella-zoster virus (vzv), hepatitis a (hav) and b virus (hbv), human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and coronavirus, epstein–barr virus (ebv), human cytomegalovirus and influenza virus [24]. glycyrrhizic acid’s preventive impact on ace2 has been reported in some studies [26]. aside from glycyrrhizic acid, hesperidin and tannic acid are also considered in medical circles; they have plant origins as well and can attach to proteins with good binding energy. hesperidin is a flavonoid extracted from citrus fruit. it has multiple biological and antimicrobial activities against human viruses. based on a study conducted in 2009, glucosyl hesperidin has an inhibiting role against the replication of influenza a virus [27]. in a study aimed at analyzing therapeutic targets for covid-19 by computational methods, it was shown that hesperidin disrupts in the interaction of ace2 with rbd [1]. as mentioned earlier, the 3clpro can be an effective target for treatment of coronavirus. a study on investigation of the effect of active compounds on the inhibition of 3clpro showed that hesperidin was the most potent inhibitor of 3clpro among the compounds which were tested. based on docking score, it was reported that hesperidin and glycyrrhizin are favorable in terms of binding to ace2 and 3clpro [28]. tmc-310911 is another fda-approved drug that has good binding with target proteins. tmc-310911 is a new investigational protease inhibitor that is being investigated for use in hiv-1 infections. tmc-310911 is currently being investigated as a potential treatment for covid-19 (https://www.drugbank.ca/).","glucosyl hesperidin,glycyrrhetinic acid,glycyrrhizic acid,glycyrrhizin,hesperidin,influenza a virus,ledipasvir,licorice,paritaprevir,protein c,simeprevir,tannic acid",,0
